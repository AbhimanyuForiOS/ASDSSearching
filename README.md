Searching Techniques (Linear(with non sorted Array) &amp; Binary(with sorted Array)):

1. Linear Search:
A linear search is the simplest approach employed to search for an element in a data set.
The time complexity of linear search O(n).

2.  Binary Search
A  Binary Search Algorithm is a searching algorithm used in a SORTED array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
The time complexity of binary search O(log n).
